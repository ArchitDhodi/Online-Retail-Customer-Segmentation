# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation

In this project, our task is to identify major customer segments on a transactional data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. This project focuses on performing customer segmentation for an online retail business. By applying various clustering techniques to the customer data, we aim to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, preferences, and demographics. This segmentation analysis can provide valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and improved customer satisfaction.
